# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

You've found the repository for my solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.

See below for instructions on how to run the tests for each language.

## Typescript

### Prerequisites
 
You should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

### Install Dependencies

From the `typescript-solutions` directory, run:
```bash
npm i
```

### Run all Tests

From the `typescript-solutions` directory, run:
```bash
npm test
```

### Additional Information

The `typescript-solutions` module uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as a test runner. See the documentation for more 
commands and information.

## Python

### Prerequisites

You should have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed.

### Install Dependencies

From the `python` directory, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run all Tests

From the `python` directory, run:

### Install Dependencies

From the `scala` directory, run:
```bash
sbt update
```

### Run all Tests

From the `scala` directory, run:
```bash
sbt test
```

### Additional Information

The `scala-solutions` module uses [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/) as a test framework. See the documentation for
[using Scalatest with sbt](https://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_scalatest_with_sbt) for more commands and information.
